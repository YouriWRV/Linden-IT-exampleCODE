# Linden-IT-exampleCODE

These are some examples of my programming history. Below you will find some explenation on each file.

**Bidding_strategyBOB.java**: This code is a script that in combination with some other scripts make agent BOB a complete negotiation agent. In this particulair file you will find                               some code that describes the bidding strategy we created for BOB. The main goal of this code is for BOB to be able to make a bid in any step of a                                   negotiation with another agent. Ofcourse the bids that BOB will make will respect the utility BOB will get from that specific bid.

**RecommendationSystem_analysis.R**: This is a small script for analysis the user experiences of a restaurant recommendation system. It is just a simple example of an table                                            analysis within R.

**TweetExtractionCode**: This code can be used to randomly extract tweets from Twitter. These were saved and later used for a sentiment analysis.

**sentimentAnalysisCode**: In here you will find the sentiment analysis that was used to analyse the tweets. 

**classifier_functions.py**: This code is part of a set of scripts that was used for the restaurant recommandation system. In here you will first find some preprocessing steps                                  which are neccessary to classify a piece of text into a category. At the end different classification algorithms were used to classify pieces of text.                              Multiple different algorthims were used to see which one performed best.
